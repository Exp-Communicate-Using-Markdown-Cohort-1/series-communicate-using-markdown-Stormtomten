# Changes
## I made changes to this file.
Why I choose to use two headers is beyond me.

### Here is an image
I used the one in the example for simplicity.

## Code examples
```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
```
```
$ git add .
Adds all files in the repository, not in the .gitignore list, to the staging area.
```
Grammar much?
